# Mindmeld

A two-person collaborative word game for idle time.

- Player A tries to get Player B to guess a word from a list of words by providing a single clue.
- Player A must obey a constraint for the clue they give Player B.
- Constraints can be things like "proper noun" "nature" or "opposite"
- Player B says their guess out loud.
- Players select "Won" if the guess was correct, "Lost" if incorrect.
- Players switch roles every guess.
- The game gets more complex the more you win and less complex the more you lose.

Still very much WIP. Latest preview can be found at [amplib.app/mindmeld](https://amplib.app/mindmeld/). An earlier prototype can be found at [mindmeld.jake.fun](https://mindmeld.jake.fun).

No network required beyond downloading the site.

Two (or more) devices enter in the same seed, cursor, and level to play the game. Devices use procedural generation to stay in sync. As long as the players progress the game the same way ("won" or "lost") the devices will stay in sync. To make sure the devices are synced, you can open the menu and check your configuration at any time.
