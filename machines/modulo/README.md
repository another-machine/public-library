# Modulo

A skinnable step sequencer with a command prompt.

Still very much WIP. Latest preview can be found at [another-machine.github.io/public-library/modulo](https://another-machine.github.io/public-library/modulo/). An earlier prototype can be found at [inst.jake.fun](https://inst.jake.fun). This is the next version of [arp.jake.fun](https://arp.jake.fun).
